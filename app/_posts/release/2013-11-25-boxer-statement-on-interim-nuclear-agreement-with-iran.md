**Washington, D.C.** – U.S. Senator Barbara Boxer (D-CA), a senior member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, released the following statement today on the P5+1 agreement with Iran regarding Iran’s nuclear program: 

**“The comprehensive sanctions put in place by Congress and the Obama Administration helped lay the groundwork for this interim agreement, which essentially freezes Iran’s nuclear weapons program in place in exchange for limited sanctions relief—relief that could and should immediately be withdrawn if Iran fails to live up to its end of the bargain.**

**“I am deeply disappointed by the negative reactions we have been hearing from some of my colleagues to the preliminary agreement. No one should underestimate the enormity of this breakthrough, which provides for daily inspections at Iranian nuclear facilities.**

 **“The Administration has left every option on the table should this agreement falter, but we should work as hard as possible across party lines to support a diplomatic solution.”**
