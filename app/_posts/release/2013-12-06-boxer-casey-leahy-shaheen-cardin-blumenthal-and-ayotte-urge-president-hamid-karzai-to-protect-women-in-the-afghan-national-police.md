**  
Washington, D.C.** – A bipartisan group of four U.S. Senators today released the following statement expressing their objections with the [newly increased allowable level][1] for taxpayer-funded contractor compensation:   
  
**“We are deeply troubled by the December 4 announcement by the Office of Management and Budget that the benchmark compensation cap for Federal Government contractors would automatically increase from $763,029 to $952,308, retroactive to January 2012, as required by statute. In the interest of fiscal responsibility and fairness, we remain strongly committed to bringing the allowable level of taxpayer-funded contractor compensation to a figure that makes common sense to the American people. If we do nothing, this figure could rise to $1.6 million by fiscal year 2020. Congress should pass our bipartisan legislative fix (S.1192) as soon as possible to avoid this affront to the taxpayers in the future.”**   
  
The statement was signed by Senators Barbara Boxer (D-CA), Joe Manchin III (D-WV), Chuck Grassley (R-IA), and Jon Tester (D-MT), who have sponsored the [Commonsense Contractor Compensation Act of 2013][2].
